# Deep Learning Project: Dept. of Public Health - Patient Satisfaction Survey
A machine and deep learning graduate research project I am working on at Purdue University. Primary goal is to determine which questions in a healthcare patient satisfaction survey most predict overall patient satisfaction. This is a classification problem, with all categorical feature variables, some of which are nominal but most of which are ordinal. The target variables, as well as most of the feature variables, have imbalanced classes to varying degrees. 

Sub-goals of the project are to create a model project framework where different criteria can be considered and iterated over in a way which "automatically" optimizes the model structure. Such aspects considered are how the data is categorized and scaled, which accuracy metrics are applied, which machine learning algorithms produce the best accuracy (over a baseline of random chance), and finally which parameters within those algorithms should be chosen for optimal prediction. In this sense, the idea is to let the data objectively dictate how the model structure should be constructed.

A final goal is to create interactive plots and visualization tools, so that the end user might get a better feel for how different survey responses predict overall patient satisfaction.
