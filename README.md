# Deep Learning Project: Dept. of Public Health - Patient Satisfaction Survey
A machine and deep learning graduate research project I am working on at Purdue University. Goal is to determine which questions in a healthcare patient satisfaction survey most predict overall patient satisfaction. This is a classification problem, with all categorical feature variables, some of which are nominal but most of which are ordinal. The target variables, as well as most of the feature variables, have imbalanced classes to varying degrees.
